# encryption
encryptato


I made a rsa encrypter in python that translates words to numbers and then encrypts them and then decrypts them and
then translates them back. It only works with lower regular letters and spaces. You also have to type what you want to
decrypt into texttonumber.py:s encryptmess function at the bottom of the file, there is no input.

To decrypt the message you just have to run the decrypt function.
